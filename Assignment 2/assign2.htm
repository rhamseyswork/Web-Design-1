        <h2>Here are my three Paragraphs</h2>

        <p id="firstParagraph">I'm a person of many interests, and once you get to know me, you'll find that there's never a dull moment. 
            My daily routine usually involves a 2-3 mile run to keep my cardio in check, followed by a healthy dose of 
            protein intake that amounts to half my body weight. However, this can be challenging, especially when I'm 
            taking supplements like creatine. Despite the challenges, I strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle and enjoy 
            every moment of it. </p>

        <p class="secondParagraph">Apart from my fitness routine, I'm always surrounded by friends and loved ones. Whether 
            I'm at the gym or relaxing at home, I like to spend my time with people. In my free time, I enjoy playing 
            video games, but with school projects and work commitments, I rarely get the opportunity to indulge in my hobby. 
            When I do have some downtime, I love to watch reality TV shows like Love Island with my girlfriend. Overall,
            I'm a person who values their health and friendships and strives to make every moment count.</p>
