        <h1 id="top">3 Paragraphs about my self</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a very interesting person Once you get to know me. I like to run, hang out with friends, and watch
            reality TV shows with my girlfriend.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start I typically run about 2-3 miles daily to get my daily dose of cardio in. I usually try to drink
            half my body weight in protein to stay healthy. Sometimes it is hard, especially when taking daily supplements
            like creatine.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my girlfriend likes to say she's the life of the party. Typically between hanging out at the gym with
            my friends or at home im usually always around people. I like to play video games in my downtime but sometimes
            it's not possible when I have school projects to complete or have to work. When I do get free time I make
            sure to spend it watching Love Island with my girlfriend. Typically id says it's rare for me to be alone
            without a friend nearby.</p>
