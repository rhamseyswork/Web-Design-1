3 Paragraphs about my self

I'm a very interesting person Once you get to know me. I like to run, hang out with friends, and watch
reality TV shows with my girlfriend.
To start I typically run about 2-3 miles daily to get my daily dose of cardio in. I usually try to drink half
my body weight in protein to stay healthy. Sometimes it is hard, especially when taking daily supplements
like creatine.
As my girlfriend likes to say she's the life of the party. Typically between hanging out at the gym with my
riends or at home im usually always around people. I like to play video games in my downtime but sometimes
it's not possible when I have school projects to complete or have to work. When I do get free time I make
sure to spend it watching Love Island with my girlfriend. Typically id says it's rare for me to be alone
without a friend nearby.
