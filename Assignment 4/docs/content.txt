5 Paragrphs for Web Page

Accounting
-------------
​​​​​​The Accounting Department offers introductory courses in Financial Accounting, Managerial Accounting and 
Microcomputer Accounting. Completion of these three courses can earn the student a certificate of completion 
in Entry-Level Accounting. Applications for this certificate are in the Business & Computing Division Office.
Advanced courses are also offered in Cost Accounting,  Intermediate Accounting,  and Federal Income Tax. 
Completion of these courses plus the Introductory Accounting courses can earn the student our more comprehensive 
Certificate of Achievement in Accounting.

We have recently added two new courses to our accounting curriculum. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) 
is our first service learning course - it involves students in actually preparing Federal and State Income Tax 
returns for qualifying community residents. Accounting with QuickBooks provides basic instruction in creating 
and maintaining a computerized accounting system with QuickBooks software.

Business
-------------
The Business & Computing Division at Orange Coast College offers courses that are applicable to more than 
financial operations and marketing. The Business division offers classes that integrate other topics and ideas, 
including Business English, International Business, Business Law, and Advanced Microcomputer Applications; 
additionally, introductory courses in business are provided for students who want to develop a strong background 
in the subject.

International Busines
-------------
Courses in International Business seek to explain the nature of primary business, as well as economic and 
political institutions. Additionally, they will explain transnational, foreign trade, and world capital and money 
markets. They will also discuss the struggle of developing nations competing in a post-industrial world.

CIS
-------------
The student will develop basic keyboarding skills on a computer keyboard using correct stroking techniques on 
letter, number, and symbol keys. Emphasis on developing accuracy and speed. No credit will be given to students 
who can already type 30 words per minute. This course may also be offered online. Offered on a pass-no pass 
basis only.

CSS Certifications
-------------
These sequences at Orange Coast College are curriculum maps for students to finish all requirements for the certificate. 
There may be advisories, prerequisites, or time requirements that students need to consider before following these 
maps. Students are advised to meet with an Orange Coast College Counselor for alternate sequencing.
