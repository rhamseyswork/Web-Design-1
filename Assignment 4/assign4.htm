        <p>Orange Coast Junior College district was established in 1947, with classes beginning in 1948. For more than
            75 years, OCC has been a leader in higher education in Costa Mesa and its surrounding communities.

            As one of the nation’s top transfer schools, and with a robust offering of career and technical education
            programs, OCC prides itself on giving students the tools they need to succeed in today’s world. Throughout
            2023, OCC will be sharing “Coast Stories” about the many ways that our College has impacted the lives of
            those in our community and around the world. To participate in the festivities, submit your story below.

            Throughout this year, as we prepare to celebrate our 75th graduating class, OCC also will host several
            events honoring the legacy of excellence that has distinguished our College as one of the nation’s best. We
            encourage you to check back here to stay informed about upcoming events, or email
            orangecoastcollege@occ.cccd.edu to be added to our email list.

            Much has changed at Coast over the past seven decades, but one thing remains steadfastly the same: our
            commitment to providing a high-quality education to all those who seek it.</p>

    <p>The Accounting Department offers introductory courses in Financial Accounting, Managerial Accounting and
        Microcomputer Accounting. Completion of these three courses can earn the student a certificate of completion
        in Entry-Level Accounting. Applications for this certificate are in the Business & Computing Division Office.
        Advanced courses are also offered in Cost Accounting, Intermediate Accounting, and Federal Income Tax.
        Completion of these courses plus the Introductory Accounting courses can earn the student our more comprehensive
        Certificate of Achievement in Accounting.

        We have recently added two new courses to our accounting curriculum. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA)
        is our first service learning course - it involves students in actually preparing Federal and State Income Tax
        returns for qualifying community residents. Accounting with QuickBooks provides basic instruction in creating
        and maintaining a computerized accounting system with QuickBooks software.</p>
    <p>The Business & Computing Division at Orange Coast College offers courses that are applicable to more than
        financial operations and marketing. The Business division offers classes that integrate other topics and ideas,
        including Business English, International Business, Business Law, and Advanced Microcomputer Applications;
        additionally, introductory courses in business are provided for students who want to develop a strong background
        in the subject.</p>
    <p>Courses in International Business seek to explain the nature of primary business, as well as economic and
        political institutions. Additionally, they will explain transnational, foreign trade, and world capital and
        money
        markets. They will also discuss the struggle of developing nations competing in a post-industrial world.</p>
    <p>The student will develop basic keyboarding skills on a computer keyboard using correct stroking techniques on
        letter, number, and symbol keys. Emphasis on developing accuracy and speed. No credit will be given to students
        who can already type 30 words per minute. This course may also be offered online. Offered on a pass-no pass
        basis only.</p>
    <p>These sequences at Orange Coast College are curriculum maps for students to finish all requirements for the
        certificate.
        There may be advisories, prerequisites, or time requirements that students need to consider before following
        these maps. Students are advised to meet with an Orange Coast College Counselor for alternate sequencing.</p>
