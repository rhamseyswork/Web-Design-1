	<h1>Rhamseys Garcia</h1>

	<p>I'm a person of many interests, and once you get to know me, you'll find that there's never a dull moment.
		My daily routine usually involves a 2-3 mile run to keep my cardio in check, followed by a healthy dose of
		protein intake that amounts to half my body weight. However, this can be challenging, especially when I'm
		taking supplements like creatine. Despite the challenges, I strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle and enjoy
		every moment of it.</p>

	<p>Apart from my fitness routine, I'm always surrounded by friends and loved ones. Whether
		I'm at the gym or relaxing at home, I like to spend my time with people. In my free time, I enjoy playing
		video games, but with school projects and work commitments, I rarely get the opportunity to indulge in my hobby.
		When I do have some downtime, I love to watch reality TV shows like Love Island with my girlfriend. Overall,
		I'm a person who values their health and friendships and strives to make every moment count.</p>
